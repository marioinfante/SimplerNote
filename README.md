# SimplerNote
Inspired by Simplenote and Samsung Memo, an ongoing Android project aimed at simplifying and synchronizing daily note taking across all your devices.

Construction:
  - Three activities:
    - 1. Displays the list of titles of notes
    - 2. Displays the contents of the notes chosen with text editor available
    - 3. Settings page
  
Current Notes:
  - The app runs and displays the first activity
  - ListView used for display of note titles, titles are clickable but lead nowhere yet

Notes for future self:
  - Start with simple text editing
  - Find a way to store the notes on user's device
  - Simperium API would work for sync across devices
  - Need page for settings
